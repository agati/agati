### Hi there ðŸ‘‹




- ðŸ”­  Iâ€™m currently working with R&D with IoMT, making Point-of-Care medical devices integration to establish communication between Intensive Care Units (ICUs) and cloud hospital service applications. The main challenges are knowing new proprietary protocols (typically using RS232C at the physical layer), interfacing with manufacturers, and helping to create code to extract medical data from these devices. Besides that, I am doing my doctorate thesis, studying the effect of Gamification in a printed circuit boardÂ´s manual assembly line that has Mixed Reality as an auxiliary tool to reduce the operatorÂ´s workload, error rates, and time to mount the PCBs. The technologies involved are Unity3D, C#, Vuforia, Java, MySQL, and Pattern Recognition. 
- ðŸ‘¯ I collaborate on consulting, technical research, and new businesses.
