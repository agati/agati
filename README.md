### Hi there ðŸ‘‹




- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my doctorate thesis, studying the effect of Gamification in a printed circuit boardsÂ´ manual assembly line that has Mixed Reality as an auxiliary tool to reduce the operatorÂ´s workload, error rates, and time to mount the PCBs. The technologies involved are Unity3D, C#, Vuforia, and Pattern Recognition.
- ðŸŒ± I'm revisiting Java language, in particular, Spring Boot Restful API to recycle my knowledge.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Open Source projects related to Internet Security best practices, consulting for start-ups, technical research, and new businesses.
